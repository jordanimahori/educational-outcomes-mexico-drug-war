# The Impact of the War on Drugs on Educational Outcomes in Mexico

This analysis is based on a research paper that I wrote for ECO439 - Empirical Methods in Microeconomics at the University of Toronto. I originally researched and wrote this paper in STATA, which I've translated into R here as part of my effort to get more comfortable with the language. 

The goal of this analysis was to estimate the impact of drug-related violence on the lifetime educational attainment of school-aged children in Mexico who would have graduated high school between 2006 and 2012. This analysis benefits from microdata on non-natural deaths compiled by INEGI and cleaned by Diego Valle in his excellent [R package](https://github.com/diegovalle/mxmortalitydb).
